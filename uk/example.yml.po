        content: !markdown |
          The immigration officer who reviews your application will want to see
          evidence that proves each requirement. Submitting your application
          without supporting evidence could lead to delays, and in some cases
          even denial.

        label: If I qualify another way do I still have to prove this requirement?
        content: !markdown |
          If you have not been a permanent resident (green card holder) for at
          least 4 years and 9 months, you might still qualify for U.S. citizenship
          on another basis. You can go back to your application to review the
          other eligibility options and change your answer.

        label: Can I continue without providing evidence?
        content: !markdown |
          If you have been a permanent resident (green card holder) for at least 4
          years and 9 months and you have a good reason why you cannot provide the
          required evidence, you can still choose to continue. Please submit an
          explanation to the immigration officer who reviews your case to explain
          why you cannot prove this requirement at this time.
